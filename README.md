Online resources for R for Data Science
<p> Each week I am recording videos found at (https://tinyurl.com/JaneWall) to be watched along with that week's .pdf file.  
The .pdf is the knitted version of the .Rmd.  I am not posting the .Rmd file as it contains the solutions to the exercises.  
However, if you are studying the material on your own or are teaching the material, just send me an email and I will add you
to the github access for that repo.</p>
